# initial alpha() call
The data set was reverse-coded based on my item interpretations.
```{r comment=""}
mt_rev <- read_excel("Bruce_CTT_data.xlsx", sheet = "Reverse Coded")
alpha(mt_rev)$total[1]
```
# alpha() call with "check.keys=TRUE"
```{r comment=""}
alpha(mt_rev, check.keys=TRUE)$total[1]
```

\newpage

# alpha() with original scores
This data set is the original data with no items that are reverse-coded.
```{r comment="", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mt_orig <- read_excel("Bruce_CTT_data.xlsx", sheet = "Transposed Responses")
alpha(mt_orig[,1:23])$total[1]
alpha(mt_orig[,1:23], check.keys = TRUE)$total[1]
```

# First pass at eliminating items
```{r comment=""}
keep <- c(1,3,4,6,8,10,11,12,14,15,16,17,18,20,21,23)
alpha(mt_orig[,keep])
alpha(mt_orig[,keep], check.keys = TRUE)$total$raw_alpha
```

# Second pass at eliminating items
```{r comment=""}
# keep <- c(1,4,6,8,10,11,12,14,15,16,17,18,20,21,23)
