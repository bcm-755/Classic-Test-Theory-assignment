```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##bcm NOTES
a) intrinsic vs. extrinsic ... how does this fit into the mativation score?  Are they at different ends of the continuum?

b) Then there's adaptive vs. mal-adaptive.  How do these fit?

c) And that do the Item Codes mean?  And how do they relate to a) and b)??

d) I HATE GitHub

```{r}
mtr <- read_excel("Motivations to Teach_Responses.xlsx")
